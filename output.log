AWK While
-------------------
First lets understand what NF in awk. as per documentation 'NF is a predefined variable whose value is the number of fields in the current record. awk automatically updates the value of NF each time it reads a record. No matter how many fields there are, the last field in a record can be represented by '
lets have a sample file, like CEOs list
-------------------

Rich Lesser, Boston Consulting Group,99%
Shantanu Narayen, Adobe,99%
Peter Pisters, MD Anderson Cancer Center,99%
Gary C. Kelly, Southwest Airlines,98%
Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. Visa Inc.,97%
Satya Nadella, Microsoft,97%
Charles C. Butt, H.E.B.,97%
Ed Bastian, Delta Air Lines,97%
Paul Cormier, Red Hat,97%
Horacio D. Rozanski, Booz Allen Hamilton,97%

AWK Selectors
Selectors used for deciding whether a particular awk action should be executed or not.
For example display only CEOs with their name starting 'S'

Shantanu Narayen, Adobe,99%
Satya Nadella, Microsoft,97%

Range patterns
-------------------
Peter Pisters99%
Gary C. Kelly98%
Alfred F. Kelly97%
Satya Nadella97%
-------------------
===================
Special expression patterns include BEGIN and END which denote program initialization and end. The BEGIN pattern matches the beginning of the input, before the first record is processed. The END pattern matches the end of the input, after the last record has been processed.

===================
AWK supports && || ! 
-------------------
 I would like to see the CEO with score greater than 97% and starting with letter S

Shantanu Narayen
===================
AWK variables
main.sh -> Print full line
,  -> Field 1 and File 2...
NR-> Number of row, usually print the current row number
1   Hello
2   GoodMorning
NF-> Number of fields, when you call NF it will print number of fields, and when you call  it will print last field, so if you have a use case like you would like to get last field, then  is the best case

-------------------
Dont mess with IFS and RS unless you know what you are doing.

===================
awk length
-------------------
number of chars in line 1=40
number of chars in line 2=27
number of chars in line 3=44
number of chars in line 4=37
number of chars in line 5=34
number of chars in line 6=28
number of chars in line 7=27
number of chars in line 8=31
number of chars in line 9=25
number of chars in line 10=44

===================
Bottom Line
AWK is a great text/file processing/manipulation with so many use cases. I just added what I have learned, if you like this post, please subscribe to my blog and add a star on my gitrepo.
Thakn you.
